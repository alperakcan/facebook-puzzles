Meep meep!

To help test whether your puzzle submissions fit the guidelines, try this
simple test puzzle. Your solution must follow the guidelines like any other
puzzle. Write a program that takes as input a single argument on the command
line. Normally this argument must be the name of a text file; however, for this
puzzle your program should ignore the argument given. Instead, your program
must print to standard out the string "Meep meep!" (without the double quotes
and with exact capitalization) followed by a single newline (not zero or two).

Input specifications

The input file will contain ASCII text that is going to be completely ignored
by your program. In fact, do not even bother opening up the file, it will just
complicate things. The input file format is as follows:

<Lots of ASCII characters that do not matter>

Example input file:

Just ignore me, I am not important.

Output specifications

The output should be the string "Meep meep!" (without the double quotes, using
exact capitalization) followed by a single newline (don't forget this part!).

Example output (newline after string):

Meep meep!
Meep meep!
